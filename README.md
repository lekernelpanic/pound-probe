# Sound probe

Vibrations of matter, particles, sound propagates in the air, in water, in any medium capable of vibrating. The vacuum of space is inhabited by a low density of particles, which by their tendency to be electrically charged interact with each other, vibrate. Space songs which cannot be heard directly by our ears, but can be heard by the sensitive instruments of the probes sailing in and sometimes outside our stellar system.

The sonification process of the collected data allows us to hear the stars, the planets, their magnetic field, the ionizing radiations, the sources and sinks of particles. Space is not silent.

In this game, you will play a little space probe, floating, traveling, discovering sounds of space.
